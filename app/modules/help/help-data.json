    "question": "How are the fruits and vegetables weighed?",
    "answer": "All fruits and vegetables vary in size and weight. You can choose any size/weight available on the website. While you shop, we will show an estimated weight and price. At the time of processing, we pack the closest size/weight and charge you for the actual weight of each item. E.g. If you order 1 kg of apples, we will try to pack exactly 1 kg or the weight closest to 1 kg. If the actual weight is 987 gm, we will bill you for 987 gm and not 1 kg."
